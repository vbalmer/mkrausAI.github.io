## <a name="Philisophy"></a>Philisophy and Mission Statement
Is it possible for a civil engineer, as a member of a university, to pursue both a successful teaching ca-reer and future-oriented science while serving as a link between research and application? And can a civil engineer make significant research contributions in another field such as architecture or computer science? From my previous experience as a post-doctoral researcher at Stanford and ETH Zurich, I can answer this question with a bright YES. 

I conduct research and teaching at the boundary of architecture, structural engineering and computer sciences with the aim of further establishing digital methods and in particular Artificial Intelligence (AI) as well as providing novel computational tools for the sustainable, appealing yet reliable design and analysis of critial structures of the built environment. As an engineer working in academia, my research follows the strictest scientific principles, research results translate into concrete and actionable recommendations for practice, in addition to professional publications. I collaborate with prestigious academic institutions as well as leading engineering offices and AEC companies including Bergmeister Ingenieure, Kuraray, Dywidag and Dlubal Software. So far I have learned, that integrating architecture, structural and environmental engineering still remains a vast challenge for design of buidlings and bridges. To take on this challenge, I use my interdisciplinary background in civil engineering and computational mechanics to conduct research in three main areas: Scientific Machine Learning for engineering, structural design, and construction materials.

In recent years, the Artificial Intelligence technology was introduced to the Architecture, Engineering and Construction (AEC) industry. Numerous application achievments have since been reached in this interdisciplinary field. However, yet today fundamental questions on the application of the relevant AI subgroups of Machine and Deep Learning for design, verification and construction situations have not answered. This lecture wants to equip current students as practicioners and researcher of the future with a basic yet solid understanding of the AI technology and what essential points to consider when applying AI to this specific domain.

The availability of data together from different sources together with the interoperability of modern Building Information Modeling (BIM) software within the design and verification workflow for AEC allow applicability of the new AI technology. This augmented building project delivery mode leverages an increase in efficiency and decreases risks due to lack of data-informed decisions in this trillion-dollar industry. However, cautious and well-thought steps need to be taken in the right direction, in order for such technologies to thrive in an industry that showcases inertia in technological adoption. To that end, this lecutre sheds some ligh on trustworthy and explainable AI. The hands-on approach during exercieses but also by conducting projects with real world applications of AI in different fields of AEC guarantees tangible outcomes of this lecture for the participants.

The course will be delivered as a three phase lecture:
1.  The first phase introduces fundamentals of the Machine and Deep Learning (ML/DL) technology, as building blocks to be considered during the development of related applications. Highlight of this lecture part are the various methods for deploying civil engineering domain knowledge to ML/DL to form Scientific ML (SciML). The approaches are discussed concerning latest developments and implementation obstacles.
2.  The second phase consists of 2 guest lectures with specific state-of-the-art industry and research applications of SciML.
3.  The third phase consists of classes for guiding and supporting participants in solving and deploying their project.

In the points of connection, students will see the importance of taking into account the application requirements when designing an AI system, as well as their impact on the building blocks. Guest speakers from both, the AI and AEC domains, provide complementary impulses for participants of this lectures.


This course will present methods of scientific machine and deep learning (ML / DL) for applications in design and construction in civil engineering. After providing proper background on ML and the scientific ML (SciML) track, several applications of SciML together with their computational implementation during the design and construction process of the built environment are examined.

By the end of the course students will develop computational thinking related to the combination of domain knowledge and latest computer science AI technology for scientific machine learning applications within the AEC domain. Specifically, the students will:

*   Gain fundamental understanding on how **AI / ML / DL technology** works and the impact it may have in the AEC industry.
*   Gain understanding on how to **combine specific knowledge from AEC domain with state-of-the-art ML/DL** to deploy SciML models.
*   **Identify limitations, pitfalls, and bottlenecks** in these applications.
*   Develop **critical thinking** on solutions for the above issues.
*   Acquire **hands-on experience** in creatively thinking and designing an application together with the computational problem solving SciML approach.
*   Use this course as a **"stepping-stone" to Machine Learning-intensive courses** offered in D-BAUG and D-ARCH.
